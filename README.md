# Alastria (Quorum) Test Environments Tidy Up Feature Branch

The purpose of this branch is to implement the last package updates so the test environment is as close as possible to the real Alastria-environment, and also to fix all known issues and extensively document the installation proccess so the environment can be installed and used out of the box.

This is the "main" branch for the task. The test environment consists of 5 separated implementations: ansible, docker, testnet, threenodes and performance. Each one of them will be dealt in a separated branch and then merged to this one.
